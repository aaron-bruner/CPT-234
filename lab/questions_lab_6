NAME: AARON BRUNER


1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?
Because it is an infinite loop.

2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?
28

3) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?
10

4) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?
1057

5) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?
1

6) What are the values in the "table" array?
{5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26}

7) what do you think the bug is?
There is an infinite loop on line 27 because it is setting search to 1 no matter what. Also, line 33 shouldn't be == but instead i > count.
